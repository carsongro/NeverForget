This app allows the user to upload photos from their photos library and give them a specific label, and record the place where they uploaded the image.
Users cac then see the picture, its name, and a map of where they uploaded the photo from. Additionally, they can edit the name of the photo, and delete unwanted photos.

Photos are saved using JSON alongside their name, description, and location.
